# OpenCV-Python-Read-and-Display-Image
In Computer Vision applications, images are an integral part of the development process. Often there would be a need to read images and display them if required. To read and display image using OpenCV Python, we use cv2.imread() for reading image to a variable and cv2.imshow() to display the image in a separate window.
